<h1><font size="8" color="#b0e0e6"><center>About Me!</h1></font></center>

<h2><font size="5" color="#20b2aa">I grew up in Veazie, Maine, which is right outside of Orono. I attended my four years of high school at John Bapst
    Memorial High School in Bangor. After graduating, I decided to continue my education close to home at Umaine.</h2></font>


<p1><font size="4" color="#6495ed">This summer, I worked full time at a call center. Highly would not recommend. Along with my full time job, I worked at Marshalls, which has been my job ever since I turned 16, so for the past
    three years. This job suits me better than a call center, but it definitely still does enable my shopping addiction. </p1></font>
