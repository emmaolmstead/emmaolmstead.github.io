<h1><font color="#ff1493">A Few of my Favorite Things</font></h1>

<p1><font size="4" color="#ff1493">I don't watch a lot of movies or TV, but my favorite shows in the past few months were Shameless and The Fosters. I
    also have a very strange guilty pleasure of watching a lot of episodes of Dr. Phil, which most people find a little
    odd about me. </p1></font>

<br></br>

<p2><font size="4" color="#ff1493">My favorite foods are anything that are full of carbs. ;) I also love coffee and
    drink an abnormal amount.</p2></font>

<br></br>

<p3><font size="4" color="#ff1493">My favorite thing to do is to spend time with my mom or my best friends. </p3></font>
