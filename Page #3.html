<h2><font color="#d3d3d3">Quebec City, Quebec</h2>

<p1><font size="5" color="#ffc0cb">Admittedly, I have done little traveling in my life; however, my favorite place that
I have gone thus far was Quebec City, Quebec. I went there over a year ago with one of my friends before we started college
    I have been other places in Canada, but something about Quebec City was so much more special to me.</font></p1>

<br></br>

<p2><font size="5" color="#9370db">Although Montreal had more things to do in a sense, Quebec City was so beautiful everywhere.
I would highly recommend going and would love to make a trip back soon.</font></p2>
